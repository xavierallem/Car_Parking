# Car Parking & Booking
#### This Project was made for Car Parking and Booking using Nodemcu, Ir sesnors , Servos and Blynk App.

### Key points:-
* It uses Node Mcu as MCU and to connect wirelessly to Blynk app
* Uses Ir sesnors to detect Cars for parking or Disable the parking if it's booked through Blynk 
* Uses Servos to demo the working or actuating of parking door space
* Uses Blynk app to book or give live feedback of the parking system to check if parking space is available or not

>If a car is booked through blynk app, a parking space is alloted and cars won't be able to access that space. After leaving the parking space, it is again available to be used or booked.


##### Note :- The pin configuration is in the code
